                As a Software Developer at Scope & Impact, I assist the
                development team in designing, developing, and maintaining the
                iSCOPE HR System, a web-based application that automates and
                streamlines human resource management processes. I write and
                test code using various programming languages, such as NextJs
                and Yii2, and collaborate with technical team to identify and
                solve technical problems. I also conduct research on new
                technologies and programming languages, assist with software
                documentation and user manuals, debug and troubleshoot system
                issues, and provide technical support to clients or end-users. I
                am a dedicated and aspiring software engineer with a strong
                desire to learn, grow, and make an impact in the field. I have a
                solid foundation in programming principles and a software
                engineering certificate from Moringa School, where I learned how
                to apply technical skills in a professional environment. I am
                motivated by challenges and opportunities to create innovative
                and user-friendly solutions that can improve lives and
                businesses. I am eager to continue developing my skills and
                knowledge, and to contribute to the success of Scope & Impact
                and its clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before joining Scope & Impact, I worked as an ICT officer at the
                Ministry of Health, Kenya, where I was involved in the Chanjo KE
                platform, a project that aimed to improve the vaccination
                coverage and data quality in the country. I headed a team of
                twenty ICT officers that facilitated recording the clients' data
                through the government portal link and supported the vaccine
                outreaches. I also headed a team of six people to configure and
                distribute over 4,000 tablets that were donated to the ministry
                by partners in various counties. I gained valuable experience in
                hardware installation, user support, network configuration, data
                entry, and internal training.
